* Manpage examples turned into tests
  Convert most examples from xorriso(1) manpage into tests.

* Enhance 'auto_isocontent'
  Extend it to use some more demanding directory tree.
  MD5s should be checked.
  All file types as of stat(2) should be tested.
  Test various comparisons:
  xorriso provides built-in means for comparison: 
  xorriso -compare_r disk_path iso_rr_path
  xorriso -indev my.iso -find /   vs. find input_dir
  bsdtar -xf my.iso               vs. input_dir

* Test for wrong CD sizes would need a new test and probably an
  automatic CD changer.

* Library unit tests - investigate the possibility to write some
  cunit-based tests (http://cunit.sourceforge.net) for both
  xorriso.h and libisoburn.h API's. The code samples could be put into
  codesamples/ directory and run by auto_cxx or a separate auto_ script.

* ??? Still to decide:
  Delete debian-testing-i386-businesscard.iso with ./run_all_auto -c
  Contra: Currently remaining large files (like downloaded ISO images) are
  simply left behind to be re-used and a boldified info message is shown
  so the users can decide for themselves what to remove or leave as well.
  Pro: Leaving 70 MB of image is quite obtrusive. Option -c is not run
  under normal circumstances. So it could well be used for total cleanup.
  Alternative: Specific option --remove_image.

* ??? Still to decide:
  Have a script ./run_all_manual
  Contra argument: if a releng sctipt is suitable to be run under a master
  script run_all*, then this releng script should be put into auto_*
  namespace , otherwise it is manual_*.
  Pro: Tests may be manual because they demand lots of resources, not
  because they need manual attention. In general the run_all_manual script
  shall spare the user the plight to read the documentation. Instead it
  shall present the manual tests, give an opportunity to skip the test,
  and ask for parameters,
