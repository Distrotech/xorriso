# This is an example for a xorriso startup file.
# If found at one of the following addresses then its text lines will get
# executed by xorriso as commands before any of its program arguments:
#   /etc/default/xorriso
#   /etc/opt/xorriso/rc
#   /etc/xorriso/xorriso.conf
#   $HOME/.xorrisorc
# Note: Command -no_rc as first program argument prevents this execution.


# Disallow the use of hard disk /dev/sda and its partitions as
# pseudo-drive (e.g. as output target of an ISO image).

-drive_class banned   /dev/sda*

  
# Allow the use of /dev/sdb, /dev/sdc, and /dev/sdd as pseudo-drives
# without the prefix "stdio:" which is usually required for device addresses
# which begin by "/dev/" but represent no CD drives.

-drive_class harmless /dev/sd[bcd]
